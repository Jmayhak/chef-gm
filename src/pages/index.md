The purpose of this site is to share philosophies on web application development life cycles and workflow.  I hope that it provides perspective to young developers and those considering starting a software company with little experience.  

This site focuses on ideas and use cases rather than specific language overviews like introduction to Javascript.

This site is intended for those who are already aware of the basics of web applications topics like HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL and system administration.  This site will attempt to provide a bigger picture to the moving parts of web applications that will be useful to those looking for a use case.  like scope, develop, test, measure, deploy.

The first few sections are tutorials that will show you proven ways to complete full stack development tasks.
