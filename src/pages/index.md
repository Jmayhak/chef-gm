#Overview

Chef-gm (general manager) is a workflow and boilerplate for developing web applications.  Its core is a combination of concepts built on Chef, Vagrant and Knife without having to put all the pieces together from scratch.  The purpose of Chef-gm is to provide a guide that will take your team from development to production using Chef and Vagrant.  The goal is to make your team's dev environments match each others and production closely while providing flexibility with deployment.

#Benefits

These benefits aren't exclusive to Chef-gm, they're what you get from infrastructure as code.

##A work in progress

Rather than publish these articles in a blog or book, they are written and updated overtime with git and Jekyll. I believe this makes the optimal experience of knowing that the patterns are still valid as technology changes.  As new tools and processes emerge, so will my workflow.  The format was inspired by those who created [phptherightway.com](http://www.phptherightway.com/).

##Audience
The purpose of this site is to share philosophies on web application development life cycles and workflow.  I hope that it provides perspective to young developers and those considering starting a software company with little experience.  

This site is intended for those who are already aware of the basics of web applications topics like HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL and system administration.  This site will attempt to provide a bigger picture to the moving parts of web applications like for scoping, developing, debugging, testing, measuring, deploying.
