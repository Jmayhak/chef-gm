During the application development cycle you will need some combination of development, staging, testing, production, and monitoring servers.  Managing a group of servers gets old pretty quick when you have more than one or two.  A sane way of managing multiple servers is through Chef Solo.  As you'll see, the [Chef-gm](https://github.com/Jsnrkd/chef-gm) project comes with a pre-configured example that you can run on a virtual machine or a remote VPS provider.


#VPS Providers
There are a many VPS solutions out there.  I recommend the following and will try to provide tutorials for each:

- AWS EC2
- Digital Ocean
- Linode
- Rackspace
